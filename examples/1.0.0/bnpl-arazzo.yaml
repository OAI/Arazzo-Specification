      Call the BNPL platform and verify the customer is eligible for the loan, which creates a customer resource. This step is skipped if the customer is already enrolled in the BNPL platform.

      Accepting the terms and conditions is set to true as the assumption is they have been accepted when this step is invoked.

      If the customer is eligible for the BNPL loan then a customer resource is created

    description: |
      Authenticate the customer and seek authorization for the loan.

      Notes:
      
      - Authenticate in this case does not necessarily mean with a valid set of credentials. It could be to prove the identity of the end user, possibly doing an UMA style interaction (which is too complex to tie into this example).
      - A redirect is returned for to be sent to the customer. The customer should follow this, but the success of the authorisation is out-of-band.
      - This flow mimics OAuth style authorization but is not an exact match as it does not rely on an authorisation code/access token exchange (as this seems somewhat artificial in this context).
